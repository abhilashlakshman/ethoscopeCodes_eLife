# ethoscopeCodes_eLife
Custom scripts to compute sleep from raw ethoscope data.

There are two files in this repository. One file (CreateSleepDataFilesFromRawEthoscopeOutput.R) is code to compute sleep profiles for flies exposed to different treatments from the raw ethoscope files. The other file (newSleepDataEtho.R) is a function for computing sleep which is used in the previous file.

Once sleep files are generated. The downstream analyses are performed as previously reported.
